Dataset from Kaggle

Business scenario and problem:
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. Provide data-driven suggestions based on understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

Predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis showed that there wasn't any missing values in the dataset. There were 3008 rows that contained duplicate values. That accounted for 20% of the data. These were handled by dropping the duplicate rows as they were not needed.

There were outliers in the tenure variable. Lower Limit: 1.5, Upper Limit: 5.5, 824 rows in tenue contained outliers.
